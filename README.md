# Stock-Management-System
Developing an SMIS

## About
<p>This is a system which aims at digitizing the stock journey of items in industries.</p>
<p>It is scalabale and can be used at any level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is purely web but with capability of scaling down to mobile apps.</p>
<p>
  SMIS is aimed at aiding in collection of digital data on:<br>
  - Initial input of current stock<br>
  - Setting alert on stock if quantity decreases<br>
  - Adding stock to existing one<br>
  - Tracking issued stock<br>
  - Viewing history of recent/specific transaction<br>
  - Exporting data that can be trained for further uses (DATA - AI)</p>
<p>Developed with love by Dev Georges <a href="https://roberto-georges.vercel.app">(Portfolio)</p>
